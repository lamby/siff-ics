DESCRIPTION:Duration: 120 mins (2h00m)\n\nKorean Horror | Film Talks To 
 open our course\, we’ll formulate a working definition of “horror” a
 s a film genre and learn about how it communicates social anxieties throug
 h monstrous metaphors. As well\, we’ll start examining how South Korean 
 horror films fit into or fall out of our American conceptions of the genre
  by examining the most classic of Korean horror tropes—the female ghost
 —in the Korean horror pathbreakers\, A Tale of Two Sisters (2004) and Me
 mento Mori (1999). In conjunction with this film talk\, SIFF will present 
 A Tale of Two Sisters in 35mm at SIFF Cinema Egyptian on Sunday\, October

DESCRIPTION:Duration: 120 mins (2h00m)\n\nKorean Horror | Film Talks As 
 horror film mastermind Kim Ki-young once said\, “When you autopsy human 
 nature\, black blood will flow out. That is what we call desire.” In wee
 k two\, we examine the anxieties inherent to desire as translated through 
 succubi-like women and vengeful killers. We’ll watch one of the most lau
 ded Korean films of all time\, Kim Ki-young’s The Housemaid (1960)\, as
  well as one of the lesser known entry’s in Park Chan-wook’s unofficia
 l “Vengeance Trilogy\,” Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002). Through the
 se famed directors’ bodies of work\, we’ll also continue to discuss wh
 at is or isn’t a horror film\, particularly in the Korean context. In co
 njunction with this film talk\, SIFF will present The Housemaid at SIFF Ci
 nema Egyptian on Sunday\, October 15. FILM TALK TICKETS Individual Talks:
