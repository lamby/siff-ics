DESCRIPTION:Duration: 360 mins (6h00m)\n\nFilm Talks If ever there was a q
 uintessential cult film\, it would be The Wicker Man. Director Robin Hardy
 ’s film saw release in its native Britain as a B-feature companion to Do
 n’t Look Now. However\, it had been cut significantly\, and its subseque
 nt US release was delayed and went unheralded. But slowly\, through drive-
 in screening and television airings\, The Wicker Man captivated audiences 
 with its wicked bait-and-switch narrative—a stodgy policeman sent to fin
 d a missing young girl uncovers something much more sinister\, leading to 
 an unforgettably nightmarish climax. It has since become a defining film o
 f the Folk Horror genre\, one-third of its “Unholy Trinity”. Join faci
 litator and SIFF Programmer Dan Doody in traveling to the remote Hebrides\
 , where we’ll unveil the secrets of Summerisle and its mysterious Mayday
  festivities. There are multiple versions of The Wicker Man\; this dissect
 ion will focus on “The Final Cut” (2013)\, the last version assembled 
 and supervised by the film’s director Robin Hardy.\n\nhttps://www.siff.n
