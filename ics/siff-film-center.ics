DESCRIPTION:Duration: 120 mins (2h00m)\n\nKorean Horror | Film Talks The
  fear of the other is one of the most central terrors animating human hist
 ory. This week\, we’ll discuss two films that plant this fear squarely w
 ithin South Korea’s history under Japanese colonization and American mil
 itary imperialism. Featuring The Wailing (2016)\, we’ll discuss the film
 ’s depiction of traditional shamanism through the subgenre of folk horro
 r and the lenses of tradition\, modernity\, and religion. As well\, we’l
 l examine the monstrous consequences of military imperialism as literalize
 d through The Host (2006)\, the film that drew global attention to directo
 r Bong Joon-ho (Parasite).  In conjunction with this film talk\, SIFF wil
 l present The Wailing at SIFF Cinema Egyptian on Sunday\, October 22. FILM
