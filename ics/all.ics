 succubi-like women and vengeful killers. We’ll watch one of the most lau
 ded Korean films of all time\, Kim Ki-young’s The Housemaid (1960)\, as
  well as one of the lesser known entry’s in Park Chan-wook’s unofficia
 l “Vengeance Trilogy\,” Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002). Through the
 se famed directors’ bodies of work\, we’ll also continue to discuss wh
 at is or isn’t a horror film\, particularly in the Korean context. In co
 njunction with this film talk\, SIFF will present The Housemaid at SIFF Ci
 nema Egyptian on Sunday\, October 15. FILM TALK TICKETS Individual Talks:
