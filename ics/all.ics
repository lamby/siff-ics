DESCRIPTION:Duration: 120 mins (2h00m)\n\nFilm Talks When Midsommar opened
  in the summer of 2019\, its success marked a renewed interest in the Folk
  Horror genre. Shortly afterwards\, Kier-La Janisse premiered her three-ho
 ur documentary on the subject\, Woodlands Dark and Days Bewitched\, an exh
 austive investigation into its cinematic history. Yet\, the question still
  remains—what exactly is Folk Horror? Is it all about human sacrifices\,
  remote rural cults\, and pagan deities? Or could it also include ancient 
 aliens\, urban decay\, nuclear threat\, maybe even public safety films?  
 SIFF Programmer Dan Doody presents a concise introduction to the world of 
 Folk Horror—its tropes\, styles\, settings\, and themes—from the genre
 ’s literary origins to the landmark “Unholy Trinity” to its recent r
 evival as a box office draw and multimedia darling.\n\nhttps://www.siff.ne
