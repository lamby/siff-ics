DESCRIPTION:Duration: 120 mins (2h00m)\n\nKorean Horror | Film Talks As 
 horror film mastermind Kim Ki-young once said\, “When you autopsy human 
 nature\, black blood will flow out. That is what we call desire.” In wee
 k two\, we examine the anxieties inherent to desire as translated through 
 succubi-like women and vengeful killers. We’ll watch one of the most lau
 ded Korean films of all time\, Kim Ki-young’s The Housemaid (1960)\, as
  well as one of the lesser known entry’s in Park Chan-wook’s unofficia
 l “Vengeance Trilogy\,” Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002). Through the
 se famed directors’ bodies of work\, we’ll also continue to discuss wh
 at is or isn’t a horror film\, particularly in the Korean context. In co
 njunction with this film talk\, SIFF will present The Housemaid at SIFF Ci
 nema Egyptian on Sunday\, October 15. FILM TALK TICKETS Individual Talks: 
 $25 Sustainer | $15 Regular | $10 SIFF member\n\nhttps://www.siff.net/prog
