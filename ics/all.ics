DESCRIPTION:Duration: 360 mins (6h00m)\n\nFilm Talks If ever there was a q
 uintessential cult film\, it would be The Wicker Man. Director Robin Hardy
 ’s film saw release in its native Britain as a B-feature companion to Do
 n’t Look Now. However\, it had been cut significantly\, and its subseque
 nt US release was delayed and went unheralded. But slowly\, through drive-
 in screening and television airings\, The Wicker Man captivated audiences 
 with its wicked bait-and-switch narrative—a stodgy policeman sent to fin
 d a missing young girl uncovers something much more sinister\, leading to 
 an unforgettably nightmarish climax. It has since become a defining film o
 f the Folk Horror genre\, one-third of its “Unholy Trinity”. Join faci
 litator and SIFF Programmer Dan Doody in traveling to the remote Hebrides\
 , where we’ll unveil the secrets of Summerisle and its mysterious Mayday
  festivities. There are multiple versions of The Wicker Man\; this dissect
 ion will focus on “The Final Cut” (2013)\, the last version assembled 
 and supervised by the film’s director Robin Hardy.\n\nhttps://www.siff.n

  Horror genre. Shortly afterwards\, Kier-La Janisse premiered her three-ho

  remains—what exactly is Folk Horror? Is it all about human sacrifices\,
  remote rural cults\, and pagan deities? Or could it also include ancient 
 aliens\, urban decay\, nuclear threat\, maybe even public safety films?  
 SIFF Programmer Dan Doody presents a concise introduction to the world of 
 Folk Horror—its tropes\, styles\, settings\, and themes—from the genre
 ’s literary origins to the landmark “Unholy Trinity” to its recent r
 evival as a box office draw and multimedia darling.\n\nhttps://www.siff.ne
